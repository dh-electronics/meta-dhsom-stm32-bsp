Subject: [PATCH 16/52] drm/stm: Prefer faster display pixel clock over slower
 ones
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

If the delta between requested pixelclock and resulting pixelclock
is larger than the delta between requested pixelclock and the next
step in available pixelclock (limited to 10% of pixelclock to avoid
too much out-of-specification operation), use the faster pixelclock.

This fixes the condition where the resulting pixelclock is much
slower than the lowest clock rate supported by the display, while
the next available pixelclock are just slightly faster than the
highest clock rate supported by the display. Using the lower clock
rate leads e.g. to subtle artifacts barely visible on the display,
like flickering pixels. Using slightly faster clock leads to no
such effect.

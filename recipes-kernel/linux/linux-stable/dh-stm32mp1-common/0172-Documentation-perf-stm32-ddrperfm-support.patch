Subject: [PATCH 171/174] Documentation: perf: stm32: ddrperfm support

The DDRPERFM is the DDR Performance Monitor embedded in STM32MP1 SOC.

This documentation introduces the DDRPERFM, the stm32-ddr-pmu driver
supporting it and how to use it with the perf tool.

+STM32 DDR Performance Monitor (DDRPERFM)
+========================================
+
+The DDRPERFM is the DDR Performance Monitor embedded in STM32MP1 SOC.
+See STM32MP157 reference manual RM0436 to get a description of this peripheral.
+
+
+The five following counters are supported by stm32-ddr-pmu driver:
+	cnt0: read operations counters		(read_cnt)
+	cnt1: write operations counters		(write_cnt)
+	cnt2: active state counters		(activate_cnt)
+	cnt3: idle state counters		(idle_cnt)
+	tcnt: time count, present for all sets	(time_cnt)
+
+The stm32-ddr-pmu driver relies on the perf PMU framework to expose the
+counters via sysfs:
+	$ ls /sys/bus/event_source/devices/ddrperfm/events
+	activate_cnt  idle_cnt  read_cnt  time_cnt  write_cnt
+
+
+The perf PMU framework is usually invoked via the 'perf stat' tool.
+
+The DDRPERFM is a system monitor that cannot isolate the traffic coming from a
+given thread or CPU, that is why stm32-ddr-pmu driver rejects any 'perf stat'
+call that does not request a system-wide collection: the '-a, --all-cpus'
+option is mandatory!
+
+Example:
+	$ perf stat -e ddrperfm/read_cnt/,ddrperfm/time_cnt/ -a sleep 20
+	Performance counter stats for 'system wide':
+
+	         342541560      ddrperfm/read_cnt/
+	       10660011400      ddrperfm/time_cnt/
+
+	      20.021068551 seconds time elapsed
+
+
+The driver also exposes a 'bandwidth' attribute that can be used to display
+the read/write/total bandwidth achieved during the last 'perf stat' execution.
+	$ cat /sys/bus/event_source/devices/ddrperfm/bandwidth
+	Read = 403, Write = 239, Read & Write = 642 (MB/s)
